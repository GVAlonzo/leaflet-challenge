Leaflet Homework - Visualizing Data with Leaflet



## STEP 1 ##
### Basic Visualization ###

This portion of the assignment visualizes **All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days** as made available from [USGS GeoJSON Feed](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) page.

Markers reflect:
- Magnitude of the eqarthquakes by *size*
- Depth of the earthquake by color *(greater the depth, the darker the color)*.
- Popups with additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked

## STEP 2 ##
### More Data ###

This portion of the assignment expands on *Step 1* by adding the boundaries as provided [here](https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/blob/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json).  This helps visualize the relation between the tectonic plates and seismic activity.

Layers have been added for improved viewability.
